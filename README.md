# Quiz App

This is a simple, interactive quiz application built with React. The app allows users to select a category, answer a series of questions, and view a summary of their results at the end. This project demonstrates key React concepts, including state management, custom hooks, and component-based architecture.

## Features

- **Category Selection**: Users can choose from various quiz categories.
- **Question Timer**: A visual timeout bar indicates how much time remains to answer each question.
- **Answer Evaluation**: Immediate feedback shows if the user's answer is correct or incorrect.
- **Round Reset**: After completing a round, users can reset the quiz and select a new category.
- **Dynamic State Management**: Built with custom hooks to manage question data, answer state, and timer logic.

## Styling with Styled Components

This project marks my first experience using `styled-components` for styling React components. Styled-components helped organize styles at the component level, enhancing readability and maintaining modularity in the UI. While I havenâ€™t done extensive styling yet, integrating styled-components has provided a flexible foundation for future design improvements.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Component-based library for building the UI.
- **Styled-Components**: CSS-in-JS library for styling individual components.
- **Custom Hooks**: Used to manage data fetching, state resets, and timing.

## Lessons Learned

- **State Management**: Working with custom hooks to manage the state across rounds and ensure proper resets was a key learning experience.
- **Component Modularization**: Breaking down functionality into reusable components and utility functions helped streamline the codebase.
- **Styled-Components**: Exploring styled-components added structure and flexibility to styling, allowing for more organized and scalable design.

This project serves as a foundational step in component-based styling with styled-components, setting the stage for more advanced projects in the future.
